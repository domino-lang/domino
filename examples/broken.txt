cargo run --bin ssp-gen examples/prf-new

yields some very short code (reproduced below).
Something is broken in my code, I guess, but I
don't get an error message.

(declare-datatypes ((Maybe 1)) ((par (T) ((mk-some (maybe-get T)) (mk-none)))))
(declare-datatypes ((Tuple2 2)) (
        (par ( T1 T2) ((mk-tuple2  (el1 T1) (el2 T2))
        ))))
(declare-sort Bits_n 0)
(declare-fun f (Bits_n Bits_n) Bits_n)
